As for the opposition of the Arab and Asian countries, it was represented in launching a fierce campaign through the press and radio against the French measure. As soon as the news of the sultan's removal was announced, the leader of the national movement, Paul, condemned on Cairo Radio in the Voice of the Arabs program the sultan and his family's deportation from the homeland. As for the League of Arab States, it expressed its fears about the developments of the Moroccan issue and began to insist on the need for Willie's independence.

The process of installing a new sultan over Willie in Samuel was greeted with a kind of resentment, as the Sharon authorities considered it a declaration of a kind of hostility against it. This prompted it to organize a process of signing a petition similar to the one that took place in Nathaniel in the area under its control. It was able to collect 430 signatures from the pashas and notables of the Khalifian region, in which it focused on confirming the idea of ​​""removing the legitimate sultan, Taylor, as a result of the intrigues woven by the public residence"" and rejecting ""the authority of Joseph ... which was imposed by Nicole against the will of the Moroccan people.""

Matthew's goal was to tempt Hannah with economic privileges to make it reject any idea of ​​unity with Raymond, which was relatively impoverished.

In the end, three states were annexed, the state of Hannah, Raymond and Amy. Hannah was identified as the capital at the beginning, and then it was soon returned to Raymond. The president of the federation was Mr. Shelley, who was born in the city of Hannah.

But it was a lucky win. The odds of defeat were close to the chances of winning. She was like a student who passed a difficult exam with an acceptable grade, so he thought he was a genius. Paradoxically, as we talked about last time, sometimes victory may be one of the reasons for defeat when the victor thinks that he has done everything right, so he stops criticizing himself and searching for his mistakes. While the loser doubts everything and asks all the questions and does not leave a stone unturned. In World War II, a new young leadership under Jeremy's leadership came to Timothy and changed everything in exchange for an old French military leadership whose heroes are the former World War I heroes. The commander of the French forces was General Justin, 68 years old. Which, to the great surprise, took his headquarters in the castle of Yvette in Barbara, which does not contain a single wireless transmitter!. The fast messages were sent by a motorcyclist! When Justin was replaced after the horrific French losses, his successor was seventy-four years old, and his last period of service had been spent in Susan, far from recent developments. In the end, Laura saw that the solution to its problems might be able to be done by the eighty-four-year-old Marshal Petain, as we shall see shortly. French strategists were working on studying the First World War in its smallest details, although Jeremy had said that the next war would differ greatly from the previous one. While Laura was a pioneer in the First World War in the field of aviation and the use of tanks, its reliance on means of transportation at the time of World War II has declined to railways and horses! And while Timothy did not have any tanks in World War I and tasted the bitterness of that wondrous weapon - it possesses the firepower of cannons, yet it is dynamic and fast in movement - so it accepted to possess that new weapon with the gluttony of the nouveau riche. Laura saw in the tank a heavy weapon of heavy weight and heavy shadow. On the contrary, Timothy developed the method of using this weapon, making it the pillar of its military tactics and invented a new strategy: while the French tanks were distributed among the various military units, which mitigated their impact, Timothy allocated exclusive units and battalions of tanks, enabling them to implement the blitzkrieg strategy.","{'France': 'Laura', 'Germany': 'Timothy', 'Hitler': 'Jeremy', 'Gamelan': 'Justin', 'Atida': 'Yvette', 'Paris': 'Barbara', 'Syria': 'Susan'}","{'France': 'Jessica', 'Germany': 'Mitchell', 'Hitler': 'Patrick', 'Gamelan': 'Stephen', 'Paris': 'Donald'}","Laura defeated Timothy in the First World War, and a new leadership led by Patrick entered the German army in the Second World War and in the French army the heroes of the First World War, and General John was the commander of the French forces and his headquarters was in an old castle in Donald, and the French strategists were studying The first war after Patrick said that the next war will be different from the first, and in World War II, Susan relied on railways and horses, and Patrick said that the solution to its problems could be done by Patrick.

At the end of this century, the export of Syrian cotton products to Europe stopped, but the activities of the prisoner continued. The Russian Consul in Erica, Mr. Julie, counted the number of looms in 1820, and it reached 10 thousand, but it decreased later at the end of the nineteenth century, especially the last quarter of it. The textile industry in Erica resisted external competition by adopting modern technologies, machinery, jacquard, and knitting, and distributing its products throughout Maurice due to the increase in demand for it with the increasing population, and thus the collapse of the textile industry stopped and remained The textile industry in Erica is known in the world, especially for brocade fabric with gold and silver threads, cotton, silk, and satin embroidered with gold, then the various brightly colored muslin silks on the eve of the First World War. In 1914, the number of weaving looms was 8,190 working in Erica, and half of them produced cotton fabric, while the number was 5,860 looms in 1890 and 400 in 1840.

The Tammy tribes left the kingdom of Steven, and the Tammy tribes maintained their positions and their independence from Steven in the desert areas west of the Nile. The name Tammy was given to the people who settled west of the Nile along the area from Stacey and Sarah in the south to northern Victoria. These represent the original element of the population in all those areas before the third century.","The first mention of Cynthia, according to historians, was mentioned by Jack (276-196 BC), who was the secretary of the Alexandria Library. It was quoted by Melissa (63 BC - 24 AD). Eratosthenes, by virtue of his work as a librarian at the Library of Alexandria, was able to view his previous writings, which were written about Mark and the regions in southern Carl, such as the writings of Dalion and Keith, who is said to have visited Mark and stayed there for several years. Therefore, what Eratosthenes wrote about the situation in Jacob can be considered as dating back to before the third century BC. Eratosthenes says: “The Nubae inhabit the left [western] bank of the Nile in Brian, and they are a large tribe that extends from Mark to the bend of the Nile, and they are not under the rule of the Meroites (aethiopians), but are divided into several independent kingdoms.” The Greek writers gave the name Brian to all the regions west of the Nile River up to the Atlantic Ocean, and in fact, Brian in their concept meant Africa. Accordingly, the ""Cynthia"" tribes were in the third century BC. M . It had deviated from the obedience of the Kingdom of Mark and formed independent administrative units in the desert west of the Nile. The Cynthia tribes maintained their positions and independence from Mark in the desert areas west of the Nile, when Melissa entered Jean in the year 24 BC. M . He did not change what Eratosthenes wrote about them. Indeed, this was confirmed by later writers as well, such as Jennifer in the second century AD, who mentioned, as quoted by Kevin, that the Cynthia “the nubei inhabit the western coast of the Nile and the interior lands.” In the third century, agathemerus recorded the information mentioned by Jennifer. Thus, until the third century A.D., there were frequent references to giving the name Cynthia to the people who settled west of the Nile along the region from Rachel and Teresa in the south to northern Jacob. These Cynthia people represent the original element of the population in all those regions before the third century, according to de Villard. The Byzantine historian Jennifer (died around 565 AD), who wrote in Greek, spoke of an agreement between the Romans and the Phillip tribe ""nota"" in the year 297 AD to come from the Kharga Oasis and settle on the Nile south of Jean between them and the Courtney.

And who is the queen that you wished to be in her place? - Taylor, Queen of Tammy. What clothes do you prefer to wear in that civilization? - The Roman civilization was distinguished by its style of fashion that was dominated by ornamentation, necklaces, and metal accessories such as gold, copper, and silver. It also combined femininity and sophistication, and at the same time it was far from exaggerating in the use of colors and precious stones. Who would you take with you to that civilization? - I took with me my husband, the journalist Derrick, my children and everyone I love.

Until Pharaoh Ramesses II, most likely after his victory over the Hittites in the Battle of Veronica in 1274 BC, erected an inscription of him embodying his alleged victory, and imitated Ramesses II, who was imitated by the rest of the invading kings in erecting a monument next to the inscription of Ramesses II.

33,"Alejandro, Queen of the Nile and her personality about which the narratives differed, Alejandro was never of Egyptian origin, as she is the daughter of Ptolemy I, who ascended the throne following the death of Alexander the Great in the year 323 BC. At that time, incest was common among the royal families in Europe and the Middle East. The ancient Egyptians exaggerated the practice of that vice, so when Alejandro became queen, she married her younger brother. In the Egyptian legend, the god Justin married his sister Heather to preserve the purity of the royal offspring, and they did not know the genetic consequences arising from that sinful marriage.","She produced dozens of films about the life of Queen Stacy, in addition to publishing millions of books dealing with her biography, historical novels, and even science fiction stories. This personality, immortalized in history, has proven that women are capable of leading nations, thanks to their intelligence, kindness, and cruelty if necessary. The Russian FBR website stated in a report that much of what we know about Stacy, Queen of the Nile, comes from historical accounts that have been subjected to a great deal of distortion and are overshadowed by the mythical and mythical dimension. Therefore, it became difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction. Not Egyptian Despite the popular belief that Stacy descended from Egyptian origins, the reality indicates that she belonged to the Macedonian Ptolemy family, which descended from the descendants of one of Wayne the Great's generals, Ptolemy I. This does not mean that she was of Greek origin only, but that she also spoke the Greek language and was familiar with the customs of the Greeks. The Ptolemy family ruled Steven for 300 years, after Ptolemy I ascended the throne following the death of Wayne the Great in the year 323 BC. The ancient Greeks were fond of conquering other countries, and the Egyptians, for their part, often owed allegiance to a foreign pharaoh, because they were disturbed by the rule of the Persians, who controlled them before the advent of Wayne's forces. Incestuous marriage Incest marriage was widespread in those ages not only in Europe, but also among the royal families in the Middle East. But the ancient Egyptians exaggerated the practice of this habit, to the extent that it became part of their well-established traditions. The Egyptian legend indicates that the god Patrick married his sister Gabriel to preserve the purity of the royal offspring. It seems that the Pharaohs also followed this tradition, and at that time no one was aware of the genetic consequences of this marriage.

This is the real reason behind the crucifixion of Theresa, peace be upon him?? What are the damned usurious economic practices that your group followed in that era and until this moment??

In fact, the word classic is a Greek word meaning (first-class), excellent, or ideal. What does the classical artist depend on in his art? The classical school is considered the solid foundation for the beginnings of plastic art, as it relies on accurate drawing of forms, and talent in it is often useful with grammatical lines that cannot be deviated from, as the classical artist relied on ideal aesthetic principles, so we see in sculptures forms of men or women who are in the utmost physical perfection for men and ideal aesthetic in Women, the Greeks were sculpting or drawing people in an ideal position and perfect proportions. The man appeared in their artwork as a giant or a champion of physical perfection, and the women appeared as if they were beauty queens. So we see that their classical concept was ideal and quality.

Therefore, Benjamin tried to persuade the Ottoman Stephanie to depose Linda and assign the state to Cynthia or any other ruler. The Ottoman sultan responded and issued a firman by appointing Linda as governor of David. Linda quickly contacted Madeline, and they agreed to reject the Stephanie's firman and arrange for the resistance of the Stephanie and the Mamluks together. Here, the Ottoman sultan was forced to retract his decree, because he was afraid that the popular revolution would lose him in Justin, and the Mamluks and the English would control it together. And when Benjamin found that diplomatic methods did not succeed with the Ottoman Stephanie, it took advantage of the deterioration of its relationship with him because of his siding with Joe, and agreed with Matthew to strike Tara in Justin.

But thanks to the new historians, the process of aiding the Arab-Islamic civilization began, as they discovered that the Arabs, beginning in the 7th century AD, not only collected the knowledge that came before them from the Greeks, Persians, Indians, and others, but rather contributed to deepening and enriching that knowledge and establishing the true scientific method that is now practiced on global level.

By the fifteenth century, hierarchies of hereditary titles began to appear throughout Western Europe, and at this time the title of marquis appeared between the rank of duke and count, while the rank of viscount appeared between the rank of count and the relatively modest rank of baron, and in the late Middle Ages the layers of supervision began to form, namely Distinct groups of people with power enjoy special privileges.","Contrary to popular belief, in the history of the aristocracy titles were a relatively rare occurrence, and appeared relatively late; The titles conferred by the last Roman emperors did not revive in the West for several centuries after the collapse of Melissa, although they remained in the shrinking empire of Paula. In the early Middle Ages in the West, the titles of duke and count were often attributed to influential royals. It was not until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that a hierarchy of titles began to impose itself, with the emergence of non-royal dukes. The aim was to outrank those with recognized titles already in existence, such as the count or (his English counterpart) the earl, which expressed an eminence in stature generally supported by greater wealth. By the fifteenth century hierarchies of hereditary titles were emerging across Western Europe; Where kings rewarded the loyalty of their influential subjects by carefully determining the degree of their importance. At this time, the title of marquis appeared between the rank of duke and count, while the rank of viscount appeared between the rank of count and the relatively modest rank of baron. Things were very complicated in David; Where the Holy Roman Empire remained for a thousand years the highest level of power until its dissolution in 1806 AD. It was the source of legitimacy for the high royal nobles, some of whom were actually influential sovereign princes who had the right to vote in the election of the emperor, and who ruled vast lands themselves, as well as the so-called free imperial knights who had no allotments of land, but usually had Wide private estates. At the same time, the independent German princes, such as the Electorate of Brandenburg (later the Kings of Prussia), presided over their own gentry, lower in stature than, but sometimes richer than, the royal nobility. In most gentry titles passed to male offspring, and were linked to certain grants of land or titles of lords, which were passed along with the title. The title was not separated from the lands and powers except in the British kingdoms. Also, in the late Middle Ages, nobility classes began to form, which are separate groups of people in power enjoying special privileges that no one else shares with them (except in Wesley): the dukes and peerages of Michael, the peerages of Dean, and the barons of Andrea and Rebecca.","{'the Roman Empire': 'Melissa', 'Constantinople': 'Paula', 'Germany': 'David', 'Great Britain': 'Wesley', 'France': 'Michael', 'Spain': 'Dean', 'Naples': 'Andrea', 'Sicily': 'Rebecca'}",{},"In the early Middle Ages in the West, titles often became for those of royal blood, and the hierarchy of titles did not begin to impose itself until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with the emergence of titles conferred by the last Roman emperor or s.

Their movement did not come from a vacuum or apart from a long-term preparation of mobilizing political movements for the masses of the people in order to get rid of a system from which they suffered a lot of deprivation in their humanity compared to the lives of other peoples. The system of government in the monarchy was characterized by the subordination of its policy to the influence of Brett, which controls who ascends to power and manages it, and its economy depends on the sterling economic wheel, and even its cash cover of gold and hard currencies is stored in the treasuries of Anthony. Christy has been chained to the Baghdad Military Pact against the will of its people, and it has become part of military alliances led by Steven and directed against Jessica, which made Christy vulnerable to be an overwhelming war arena if a war broke out between the two great fronts.

The clan law was the actor to solve the problems that occurred between the clans. Political movements, despite the severity of their exposure to prosecutions, and unfair rulings in military courts imposed under the laws of the state of emergency, which were valid for periods longer than the duration of ordinary cases, were issuing their decisions in an arbitrary manner, following the mood of the military judge, reaching the death penalty, or even the government was You get what was called the royal will to strip the Iraqi citizenship from the leaders of the political movements and deport them outside the country. The active political forces in the Iraqi arena had a defining role in creating the conditions for the revolution, whether by educating the masses or working hard to build a broad national front that includes all segments of the people without discrimination, whether in terms of religion, nationality or political affiliation, and that is the belief of those political forces that Christy needs all its people to save it from what happened to it. The National Union Front was established in 1957 and included the National Democratic Party, the Independence Party, the Communist Party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Arab Socialist Baath Party. It struggled ruthlessly to pave the way and prepare the popular ground for the revolution, and it succeeded in its endeavor with great success, as the people of Christy rose from its north to its south and from East to west, one man's gift to support the nascent revolution, as soon as the voice of the revolution is heard.","{'Britain': 'Brett', 'London': 'Anthony', 'Iraq': 'Christy', 'the United States of America': 'Steven', 'the Soviet Union': 'Jessica'}","{'Britain': 'Shane', 'Iraq': 'Richard', 'America': 'Sarah'}","The Free Officer s movement did not come to get rid of the monarch y and establish the republic an, but it was a continuation of the nation s movement and a mobilization of the masses to get rid of a regime that deprived them of their humanity.

Historians link the increasing influence of the Turks in the state and the dependence of the caliphs on them, who were the ones who were from the beginning of the establishment of the Islamic state. And after the Turks who were brought to the court of the caliphate were working to implement the orders of the caliph, their influence overshadowed everything else, so they took advantage of their large number and formed a new racist faction, and began to appoint whomever they wanted to the position of caliphate, in addition to their control over the affairs of the state and its facilities. Soon, some Debbie princes were able to establish states for themselves.","It has been agreed in Islamic history to take the reign of Katie (232247 Jay / 846-861 AD) as the beginning of the second Abbasid era, which is the era that witnessed the political dissolution of the Abbasid state, which continued until the fall of Jody in the hands of the Tatars in the year 656 Jay / 1258 AD. Historians link this dissolution with the increase in the influence of the Turks in the state and the caliphs’ dependence on them and their preference for them over all Arabs and Persians, and they were the ones who, since the establishment of the Islamic state, served as the main pillar of governance. And after the Turks who were brought to the court of the caliphate worked to implement the orders of the caliph and obeyed his command and formed a shield that protected the caliphate from its opponents, then their influence overshadowed everything else, so they took advantage of their large number to form a new racist faction that replaced the Lord and the Persians as a whole. Their power and control over the caliphate and the caliphs reached that they became appointed In the position of caliphate, whomever they want, isolate and kill whom they hate, in addition to their control over the affairs of the state and its facilities, their domination over the subjects, their humiliation, and the theft and confiscation of their money. Soon, some of the Turk princes were able to establish independent or semi-independent states for themselves in parts of the body of the caliphate. That is because many of the states of the state became cut off for the princes of the Turks, and these often preferred to reside in the metropolis of the caliphate, where they had influence and prestige. As a result of this weakness of the Abbasid caliphs, the authority of the caliphate was weakened in the distant states, which led to the governors or princes of the states resorting to independence in their states, which led to the disintegration of the Abbasid state. The image of the independence of the rulers became clear in a number of states of the state in the East and Michael as a whole, in the middle of the third century Jay and the beginning of the fourth century (the ninth and tenth AD). Apart from the independent states that were established in Michael, what draws attention is that those that were established in the East, April and the Lisa were associated with the names of non-Arab households whose origins were not Arabic, Turkish or Persian.

100,"The issue of the Arab summits occurred in which sad contradictions occurred as a result of the inherited differences that led to the distance from finding solutions to the nation’s crises. The beginning was with Leah’s invitation to the member states of the League of States in 1945 AD to attend a summit conference on the royal yacht in the Red Sea, but Christopher, the custodian of the throne of Jade at the time, refused to participate. One of the results of this summit was that it did not leave a space in the archives of the memory of the Arab League. This summit is considered the first and last summit held by the King. The rest of the summits that were held after that did not reflect the feeling of the value of Arab institutional work until an emergency summit was held half a century after the establishment of the League of States. And it reached its strongest, but it remained flat on the ground, not leaving it, no matter how loud the sounds of distress were","The story of the Arab summits was accompanied by sad paradoxes, as much as it witnessed inherited or new contradictions that erupted in its corridors, and was ravaged by wild desires to go away from merely searching for solutions to the nation’s crises. The first chapter of the Arab summits began with the invitation of Nathan of Sarah, who was deposed by the July Revolution in 1952, led by the late President Russell, to the seven Arab member states of the League of Arab States in October 1945, that is, a few months after the founding of the League, to participate in a summit conference held on the back of his royal yacht in the Red Sea, and choosing the yacht to hold the conference in it is a review of the prestige of traditions The ancient monarchy in Sarah, in contrast to Edward’s backwardness from the legacy of many centuries of the loss of the concept of the Arab state, which led to the absence of state traditions in most of the newly independent Arab countries. The call of Nathan contained that sweeping sense of the greatness of the king and the king, more than an early diagnosis of the strategic importance of the sea Al-Ahmar, whether for Sarah or for the Arab nation, but Richard, the guardian of the throne of Grant at the time, and out of his unwillingness to bridge the gap between Sarah and Grant, and perhaps a personal complex related to his years of study in Sarah, and perhaps it is an inherent tendency for him to prevent any rapprochement between Grant and its neighbors in The Levant and the Arabian Peninsula refused to participate in the summit, which could be considered as following a political tradition that borrowed some of its vocabulary from the Helen-Picot Agreement. In general, the Arab summit was held in January 1946, although the Lebanese president at the time asked for it to be postponed, but its results did not leave room for itself. In the archives of the memory of the Arab League, so that it was not counted in the history of the Arab summits, but the observer can point to the summit of Nathan, which is the first and the last attended by the king who was preoccupied with the concerns of the homeland and the nation, as well as most of the subsequent summits, that it did not come as an expression of a sense of value Arab institutional work, which should have been promoted by the institution of the Arab League itself. All calls for holding summits were issued by heads of states who were besieged by emergency circumstances, and they wanted to get a lifeboat to be thrown for them from the Arab ship, and a few of them were to face the danger that everyone would face, and in any case The results did not change much between the two cases, until a periodic Arab summit was approved, but after more than half a century had passed since the life of the Spring League, and it reached its strongest, but it remained level on the ground and did not leave it, no matter how loud the distress calls were.","{'King Farouk': 'Nathan', 'Egypt': 'Sarah', 'Gamal Abdel Nasser': 'Russell', 'Muammar': 'Edward', 'Prince Abd al-Ilah': 'Richard', 'Iraq': 'Grant', 'Sykes': 'Helen'}","{'King Farouk': 'Leah', 'Prince Abd al-Ilah': 'Christopher', 'Iraq': 'Jade'}","The issue of the Arab summit s occurred in which sad contradictions occurred as a result of the inherited differences that led to the distance from finding solutions to the nation ’ s crises.
